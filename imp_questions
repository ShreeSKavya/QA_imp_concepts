.bashrc :- .bashrc is a scripted file that executes when user logs in.
Know_host_file :-It is a file that contains public keys of the host accesed by the user.
shared library :- It is a collection of groovy scripts that shared between different jenkins jobs.
Number of executors in jenkins :- Number of concurrent jobs that can run.If we want to run multiple jobs simultaneously at a time then we need more  number of executors.
what is label :- when we creating new slave node,jenkins allows us to tag a slave node with label.Label is the way of naming one or more slaves.
what is x-args :- X-args is a unix command used to build and executes commands from standard inputs.When we need to take output from one command and used it as arguement to another command ,
                   then we use x-args

                      git revert <commit_id>
what is git reset :- It is the command use to  vanish a commit completely from local repo and remote repo. git reset --hard <commit_id>
what is git :- Git is source code management tool or version control tool that is used to track the changes,maintainance and control the changes from source code.
Difference between git and github :- While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, 
                                      GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository. 

what is git branch and its uses : Branching means diverging from the mainline and continue to work separately without messing with the mainline.

jenkins:
what is jenkins :- It is open source automation server,hat is used to automate all sorts of tasks related to build,testing and deploying softwares.
what is jenkins file :- It is a file that contains all job configurations in groovy.
Groovy means It is the java based scripting language used by jenkins pipeline.
How do you define environment variables in jenkins pipeline : Environment directives specifies sequence of key-value pair which will be defined as 
                  environment variables for all the steps or stage-specific-steps depending on where environment directive is located within pipeline.
                we use 
                  environment {
                     variable_name=value
                }
                The value of these user-defined environments are made available to pipeline steps by using env object.
How do you define parameters in jenkins pipeline : The parameters directives gives list of parameters that the user should provided when triggering the pipeline.
                  The values for these user-specified parameters are made available to Pipeline steps via the params object
                  pipeline {
                      agent any 
                      parameters {
                                string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?')
                            
                                text(name: 'BIOGRAPHY', defaultValue: '', description: 'Enter some information about the person')
                            
                                booleanParam(name: 'TOGGLE', defaultValue: true, description: 'Toggle this value')
                            
                                choice(name: 'CHOICE', choices: ['One', 'Two', 'Three'], description: 'Pick something')
                            
                                password(name: 'PASSWORD', defaultValue: 'SECRET', description: 'Enter a password')
                           }
                       stages {
                            stage('Example') {
                                steps {
                                    echo "Hello ${params.PERSON}"
                    
                                    echo "Biography: ${params.BIOGRAPHY}"
                    
                                    echo "Toggle: ${params.TOGGLE}"
                    
                                    echo "Choice: ${params.CHOICE}"
                    
                                    echo "Password: ${params.PASSWORD}"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                      
                  }

How do you define triggers in jenkins pipeline : The triggers directive defines the automated ways in which the Pipeline should be re-triggered.

    cron
        Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which the Pipeline should be re-triggered, 
        for example: triggers { cron('H */4 * * 1-5') }
        pipeline {
                  agent any
                  triggers {
                      cron('H */4 * * 1-5')
                  }
                  stages {
                      stage('Example') {
                          steps {
                              echo 'Hello World'
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }

pollSCM
        Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which Jenkins should check for new source changes. 
        If new changes exist, the Pipeline will be re-triggered. 
        For example: triggers { 
			pollSCM('H */4 * * 1-5') 
			}

How do you define tools in jenkins pipeline : A section defining tools to auto-install and put on the PATH. This is ignored if agent none is specified.
                pipeline {
                    agent any
                    tools {
                        maven 'apache-maven-3.0.1' 
                    }
                    stages {
                        stage('Example') {
                            steps {
                                sh 'mvn --version'
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
Agent
	- An agent is a declarative used to define the execution method for pipeline stages.
	- agent is the one which tell stages to execute on which node and its executor.
	- Agent can be specified at two levels 
				a. pipeline level 
				b. Stage level
			
	Types of agent 
		any 
			- This is the default agent, If I wont specify any agent this will be considered.
			- Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on any available agent. For example: agent any
			
		none 
			-  When applied at the top-level of the pipeline block,there is no global agent will be allocated for the entire Pipeline run and 
            			each stage section will need to contain its own agent section. 
        			For example: agent none
				
		label 
			- we can define agent as label at pipeline to run all the stages of pipeline
			  on a perticular node with label.	

Maven:
what is maven :-Maven is open source build tool developed to build ,publish and deploy several projects at once for better project management.
what is pom.xml :- POM means Project Object Model.
                    It is a file that contains information about the project and configuration details for maven to build the project.

AWS:
Explain Amazon EBS and its types :
	Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. 
		EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices.
		EBS volumes are persistent. They can live beyond the life of the ec2 instance that they are attached to. They can be attached/detached to and from different ec2 instances.
		An EBS volume can only be attached to 1 ec2 instance at a time (Multi Attach EBS Volume can be attached to multiple instances). They are mounted to the file system.
		You can backup the EBS volume into a snapshot, which can later be used/restored into a new EBS volume.

LINUX:

1.Why we use 
  - ping : To check the connection b/w 2 networks

  - telnet : It is used for authentication and authorization purpose.
	     It is used to create the remote connection with the system over a TCP/IP network.
	     To connect to the remote machine from the local machine, we should run telnet in the following pattern:

			$ telnet -l [username] [remote machine IP] [port (optional)]

  
  - To list all the open files : $ lsof
  
  - To check the port open or not 
      List all busy ports in linux
       1. sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
       2. sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
            - To list all the listening ports : $ netstat -l (-l refers to listening)
	 
              The options used in this command have the following meaning:

		-t - Show TCP ports.
		-u - Show UDP ports.
		-n - Show numerical addresses instead of resolving hosts.
		-l - Show only listening ports.
		-p - Show the PID and name of the listener’s process. This information is shown only if you run the command as root or sudo user.
       
   - To check a specific port open or not  
   	sudo lsof -i:<port_number>
	example: sudo lsof -i:8080

  - To display the system performance information : $ Top

  - nslookup : The nslookup command is a tool used to query Domain Name System (DNS) servers and retrieve information about a specific domain or IP address. 
                                 (or)
                It is used to resolve a domain name.
   - tree command => It Displays directory paths and (optionally) files in each subdirectory.

                   This file is typically located in the user's home directory and is executed every time a new terminal window is opened or a new Bash shell is started.

	.profile => The .profile file is a configuration file that is used to set up and customize the shell environment when a user logs in to the system. 
		    This file is typically located in the user's home directory and is executed only once when the user logs in to the system.

	.bash_profile => The .bash_profile file is a configuration file that is used to set up and customize the Bash shell when a user logs in to the system. 
			This file is typically located in the user's home directory and is executed only once when the user logs in to the system.

		*This has no downtime.

	Recreate :
		*Suppose there are 5 instances of your app running
		*When deploying a new version, we can destroy the 5 instances of older version and then deploy 5 instances of newer version.
		*The issue is there will be a downtime.
		*This is majorly done during major changes, breaking changes or when backward compatibility is not possible.
		*This is not the default strategy in K8s.

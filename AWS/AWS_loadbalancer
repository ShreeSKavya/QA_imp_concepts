Q: what is Load-balancer in aws? why we use it?

A: Load balancer is a service which uniformly distributes network traffic and workloads across multiple servers or cluster of servers.Load balancer in AWS increases the availability and fault tolerance of an application.
    Load balancer coomonly uses round-robin technology.
    * Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. 
    * It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. 
    * Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time.
    * To make an AWS ELB accept incoming traffic you have to configure them by specifying one or more listeners. A listener is a process which will check for connection requests.

Q: what are the types of Load-balancer in aws? 

A: we have Three types of load balancers 
  a.Application Load balancer(ALB)
  b.Network Load balancer(NLB)
  c.Gateway Load balancer(GWLB)

Application Load balancer(ALB): 
    * An Application Load Balancer in AWS makes routing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPs) of the OSI model.
    * If you want to perform load balancing on Layer 7(application layer),or If you want to perform load balancing at HTTP layer,Then go for ALB
    * This layer is slightly costly and it has some additional capabilities.It is slightly slower also
    * ALB supports path-based and host-based routing,

 Network Load balancer(NLB): A Network Load Balancer makes routing decisions at the transport layer of the OSI model .It performs routing on (TCP/UDP) packets,not on HTTP packets.  
      * If you want to perform load balancing on Layer 4(transport layer),Then go for NLB
      * It can handle millions of requests per second
      * NLB is less costly and has low latency.High trasmission of data takes place in NLB.
      * It is used for Game servers,youtube,streaming platform.
      * NLB creates sticky sessions(All packets go for one single server)

 Gateway Load balancer(GWLB): It deals with VA(Virtual Apliances) like VPN kind of application,Firewall kind of application.
          * It offers High security compare to ALB and NLB
          * It sends highly encrypted packets to the VA.


The request goes to server from client side through 7 layers.and get the response from the server.
OSI (Open System Interconnection) model consists of 7 layers
1.Application Layer(Layer 7) : It is the one which is layer 7 in which what kind of protocol you used to access the server.

2.Presentation Layer(Layer 6): In this layer TLS (Transport Layer security) based requests send to the server.

3.Session Layer(Layer 5): This layer handles with session objects.

4.Transport Layer(Layer 4): This is key layer,In this layer request splits into multiple packets or small chunks.
      * This layer makes sure that the request comes from client to server in a secure way and in small packets.

5.Network Layer(Layer 3): Small packets wants to travel from client to server through multiple routes.

6.Data link Layer(Layer 2): The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer.
  * The packet received from the Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of the NIC(Network Interface Card).

7.Physical layer(Layer 1): In this layer all the cabels connected to the server.


* TLS : Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) : TCP is a transport-layer protocol. It provides a reliable virtual-circuit connection between applications.
             a.Data is sent without errors or duplication and is received in the same order as it is sent.
             b.TCP treats the data as a stream of bytes.

* User Datagram Protocol (UDP) : UDP is also a transport-layer protocol and is an alternative to TCP.
          a.It provides an unreliable datagram connection between applications. Data is transmitted link by link; there is no end-to-end connection.
          b.The service provides no guarantees. Data can be lost or duplicated, and datagrams can arrive out of order.

* Internet Protocol (IP) :
         In terms of the OSI model, IP is a network-layer protocol. It provides a datagram service between applications, supporting both TCP and UDP.

* protocol : A protocol is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating data. Rules are defined for each step and process during communication between two or more computers

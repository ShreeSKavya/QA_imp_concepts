List:  It is ordered collection of data and that can be of multiple data types like integer,string etc
       It is mutable.you can change the elements by adding or removing or modifying the data.
       Lists are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
     EX:- list_1 = ["Kavya","Jeevan","Bhavya"]
   a. For adding         ==>                 list_1.append("Ashika")  ==> It will add the element at the last position  ==> list_1 = ["Kavya","Jeevan","Bhavya","Ashika"]
   b. For adding at perticular position ==>  list_1.insert(2,"megha") ==> list_1 = ["Kavya","Jeevan","megha","Bhavya","Ashika"]
   c.For deleting               ==>          list_1.pop()            ==> It will remove the element at the last position  ==> list_1 = ["Kavya","Jeevan","megha","Bhavya"]
   d.For adding at perticular position ==>   list_1.pop(2) ==> list_1 = ["Kavya","Jeevan","Bhavya"]
             or
   e.For adding at perticular position ==> list_1.remove("Jeevan")  ==> list_1 = ["Kavya","Bhavya"]


Tuple : A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements enclosed in parentheses ( ). 
        Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed, making it an immutable data type.
